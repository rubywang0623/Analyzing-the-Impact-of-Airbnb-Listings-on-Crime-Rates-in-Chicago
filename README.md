  ## Introduction & Motivation
As we all know, crime is one of the most significant challenges facing the city of Chicago, and through our analysis, we aim to investigate its impact on Airbnb's business operations. It is quite plausible that a potential customer may feel uneasy or even deterred from booking accommodations located in neighborhoods where crime rates are high, as the possibility of encountering or witnessing criminal activity could create a sense of discomfort and insecurity. This hesitation can have a direct effect on Airbnb's overall bookings, particularly in areas with higher crime rates.
Our goal is to shine a light on the challenges customers are experiencing when considering properties in such neighborhoods, where safety concerns may be the key factor causing them to hesitate in making a booking. By drawing attention to these crime-centric locations, we hope to encourage Airbnb to consider implementing additional safety protocols and measures that can instill greater confidence in potential guests. With enhanced safety measures in place, we believe both the customersâ€™ sense of security and satisfaction will improve, leading to increased bookings, ultimately benefiting both Airbnb and the individual hosts.
Moreover, by proactively addressing the issue of safety, Airbnb can foster a stronger relationship with its customer base, promoting trust and long-term loyalty. We want to ensure that Airbnb's reputation as a safe and reliable platform is not compromised by the negative perception of crime in certain neighborhoods.
